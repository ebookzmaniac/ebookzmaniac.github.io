This is not full blog post. This is too late, I am too tired.
I don't know exactly whether I will expand this post, so I'll leave some reminder of how this blog was created: the **idea** of definite *optimism*. :)
___

**Monopoly** idea:
> All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

And 4 quadrants about different **styles of expecting future**:

> Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes Americans today. In middle school, we’re encouraged to start hoarding “extracurricular activities.” In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular.
